# The Plane

.5. A surface is that which has length and breadth.

A surface is space of two dimensions. It has no thickness, for if it had any, however small, it would be space of three dimensions.

.6. When a surface is such that the right line joining any two arbitrary points in it lies wholly in the surface, it is called a plane.

A plane is perfectly flat and even, like the surface of still water, or of a smooth floor.â€”Newcomb.
