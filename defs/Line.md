# The Line

.2. A line is length without breadth.

A line is space of one dimension. If it had any breadth, no matter how small, it would be space of two dimensions; and if in addition it had any thickness it would be space of three dimensions; hence a line has neither breadth nor thickness.

.3. The intersections of lines and their extremities are points.

.4. A line which lies evenly between its extreme points is called a straight or right line, such as AB.

If a point move without changing its direction it will describe a right line. The direction in which a point moves in called its “sense.” If the moving point continually changes its direction it will describe a curve; hence it follows that only one right line can be drawn between two points. The following Illustration is due to Professor Henrici:—“If we suspend a weight by a string, the string becomes stretched, and we say it is straight, by which we mean to express that it has assumed a peculiar definite shape. If we mentally abstract from this string all thickness, we obtain the notion of the simplest of all lines, which we call a straight line.”
