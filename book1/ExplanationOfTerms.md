**Axioms** — “Elements of human reason,” according to Dugald Stewart, are certain general propositions, the truths of which are self-evident, and which are so fundamental, that they cannot be inferred from any propositions which are more elementary; in other words, they are incapable of demonstration. “That two sides of a triangle are greater than the third” is, perhaps, self-evident; but it is not an axiom, inasmuch as it can be inferred by demonstration from other propositions; but we can give no proof of the proposition that “things which are equal to the same are equal to one another,” and, being self-evident, it is an axiom.

**Propositions** which are not axioms are properties of figures obtained by processes of reasoning. They are divided into theorems and problems.

A **Theorem** is the formal statement of a property that may be demonstrated from known propositions. These propositions may themselves be theorems or axioms. A theorem consists of two parts, the hypothesis, or that which is assumed, and the conclusion, or that which is asserted to follow therefrom. Thus, in the typical theorem,

`If X is Y, then Z is W,`
the hypothesis is that X is Y , and the conclusion is that Z is W.

Converse Theorems.—Two theorems are said to be converse, each of the other, when the hypothesis of either is the conclusion of the other. Thus the converse of the theorem (i.) is—

`If Z is W, then X is Y.`
From the two theorems (i.) and (ii.) we may infer two others, called their contrapositives. Thus the contrapositive

`of (i.) is, If Z is not W, then X is not Y ;	(iii.)`
`of (ii.) is, If X is not Y , then Z is not W.	(iv.)`
The theorem (iv.) is called the obverse of (i.), and (iii.) the obverse of (ii.).

A **Problem** is a proposition in which something is proposed to be done, such as a line to be drawn, or a figure to be constructed, under some given conditions.

The **Solution** of a problem is the method of construction which accomplishes the required end.

The **Demonstration** is the proof, in the case of a theorem, that the conclusion follows from the hypothesis; and in the case of a problem, that the construction accomplishes the object proposed.

The **Enunciation** of a problem consists of two parts, namely, the data, or things supposed to be given, and the quaesita, or things required to be done.

**Postulates** are the elements of geometrical construction, and occupy the same relation with respect to problems as axioms do to theorems.

A **Corollary** is an inference or deduction from a proposition.

A **Lemma** is an auxiliary proposition required in the demonstration of a principal proposition.

A **Secant** or **Transversal** is a line which cuts a system of lines, a circle, or any other geometrical figure.

**Congruent** figures are those that can be made to coincide by superposition. They agree in shape and size, but differ in position. Hence it follows, by Axiom viii., that corresponding parts or portions of congruent figures are congruent, and that congruent figures are equal in every respect.

**Rule of Identity** — Under this name the following principle will be sometimes referred to: — “If there is but one X and one Y , then, from the fact that X is Y , it necessarily follows that Y is X.”
