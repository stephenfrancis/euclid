Let it be granted thatâ€”

i. A right line may be drawn from any one point to any other point.

When we consider a straight line contained between two fixed points which are its ends, such a portion is called a finite straight line.

ii. A terminated right line may be produced to any length in a right line.

Every right line may extend without limit in either direction or in both. It is in these cases called an indefinite line. By this postulate a finite right line may be supposed to be produced, whenever we please, into an indefinite right line.

iii. A circle may be described from any centre, and with any distance from that centre as radius.

If there be two points A and B, and if with any instruments, such as a ruler and pen, we draw a line from A to B, this will evidently have some irregularities, and also some breadth and thickness. Hence it will not be a geometrical line no matter how nearly it may approach to one. This is the reason that Euclid postulates the drawing of a right line from one point to another. For if it could be accurately done there would be no need for his asking us to let it be granted. Similar observations apply to the other postulates. It is also worthy of remark that Euclid never takes for granted the doing of anything for which a geometrical construction, founded on other problems or on the foregoing postulates, can be given.
