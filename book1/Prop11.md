# Proposition 11: Draw Line Perpendicular to Given Line at Given Point

## Problem
* From a given point (C) in a given right line (AB) to draw a right line perpendicular to the given line.

## Solution
* In AC take any point D, and make CE equal to CD [iii.].
* Upon DE describe an equilateral triangle DFE [i.].
* Join CF.
* Then CF shall be at right angles to AB.

## Demonstration
* The two triangles DCF, ECF have CD equal to CE (const.) and CF common;
* therefore the two sides CD, CF in one are respectively equal to the two sides CE, CF in the other,
* and the base DF is equal to the base EF, being the sides of an equilateral triangle (Def. xxi.);
* therefore [viii.] the angle DCE is equal to the angle ECF, and they are adjacent angles.
* Therefore (Def. xiii.) each of them is a right angle, and CF is perpendicular to AB at the point C.
