# Proposition 15: Opposite Angles of Intersecting Lines are Equal

## Theorem
* If two right lines (AB, CD) intersect one another, the opposite angles are equal (CEA = DEB, and BEC = AED).

## Demonstration
* Because the line AE stands on CD, the sum of the angles CEA, AED is two right angles [xiii.];
* and because the line CE stands on AB, the sum of the angles BEC, CEA is two right angles;
* therefore the sum of the angles CEA, AED is equal to the sum of the angles BEC, CEA.
* Reject the angle CEA, which is common, and we have the angle AED equal to BEC.
* In like manner, the angle CEA is equal to DEB.

The foregoing proof may be briefly given, by saying that opposite angles are equal because they have a common supplement.
