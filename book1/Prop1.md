# Proposition 1: Equilateral Triangle From Finite Right Line

## Problem
* On a given finite right line (AB) to construct an equilateral triangle.

## Solution
* With A as centre, and AB as radius, describe the circle BCD (Post. iii.).
* With B as centre, and BA as radius, describe the circle ACE, cutting the former circle in C.
* Join CA, CB (Post. i.).
* Then ABC is the equilateral triangle required.

## Demonstration
* Because A is the centre of the circle BCD, AC is equal to AB (Def. xxxii.).
* Again, because B is the centre of the circle ACE, BC is equal to BA.
* Hence we have proved: `AC = AB`, and `BC = AB`.
* But things which are equal to the same are equal to one another (Axiom i.);
* therefore AC is equal to BC;
* therefore the three lines AB, BC, CA are equal to one another.
* Hence the triangle ABC is equilateral (Def. xxi.);
* and it is described on the given line AB, which was required to be done.

## Exercises

The following exercises are to be solved when the pupil has mastered the First Book:

1. If the lines AF, BF be joined, the figure ACBF is a lozenge.
2. If AB be produced to D and E, the triangles CDF and CEF are equilateral.
3. If CA, CB be produced to meet the circles again in G and H, the points G, F, H are collinear, and the triangle GCH is equilateral.
4. If CF be joined, CF2 = 3AB2.
5. Describe a circle in the space ACB, bounded by the line AB and the two circles.
